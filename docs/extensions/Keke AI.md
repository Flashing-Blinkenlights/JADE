## Scopes
### Statement
Statements are three words aligned from top-to-bottom or left-to-right that form a (possibly invalid) rule.

If a statement is valid, then it creates a rule.
The statement may be destroyed at any point in time, in which case the corresponding rule is destroyed (if it is not represented by another, identical statement).

Valid rules are:
1. Noun-Operator-Property, e.g. Baba is You
2. Noun-IS-Noun, e.g. Baba is Keke
