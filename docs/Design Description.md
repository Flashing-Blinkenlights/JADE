## Comments
Developers are encouraged to make use of `FIXME: `, `TODO: ` and `NOTE: ` strings in their code to help other people to navigate potential issues in the code
- `FIXME: ` should be used where there is a serious issue, such as unstable or badly optimised code
- `TODO: ` should be used where there is a minor issue, such as suboptimal formatting or lacking documentation
- `NOTE: ` should be used where there is a caveat or footnote that warrants particular attention, but is not an issue
