# Tutorial Outline
This document provides a pseudocode tutorial outlining all features of JADE [0.1]. It is strongly recommended to maintain a similar structure in the JADE implementation using the same tags to facilitate fast searching between JADE implementations
Each section should be able to function independently to demonstrate the minimum and maximum usage of each feature.

Glossary:
- Tag: a comment in ALL-CAPS preceded by a hash, e.g. `#TAG`
